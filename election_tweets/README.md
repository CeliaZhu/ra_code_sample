# Final Project
`data/raw` contains the three raw datasets I used. 

`data/built` contains the datasets cleaned by `step1_data_wrangling.R`. 

`step2_text_processing.R` is the script performing text processing and sentiment analysis (2 plots produced). 

`step3_analysis.R` is the script where I fitted a model and reported basic results (2 plots produced). 

`step4_interactive_plot/app.R` is the script for the Shiny app. 

The writeup is `output/writeup/report.pdf`.

Figure outputs are in `output/figures`. 

Table outputs are in `output/tables`.

To replicate the results, please first open the `.Rporj` file and run the scripts in a project environment.
