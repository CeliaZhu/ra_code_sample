## Code Samples for Research Assistantship 
This repository houses my code samples used in applying for research assistatnship. 

In the master branch, I wrote "monolithic" code samples using `markstat` (in the "Stata" folder, with a PDF output) and `Rmd` (in the "R" folder, with a PDF output).

I also modularized the two samples in the two branches, "Stata" and "R", to better reflect my usual workflow.
