## Code Samples for Research Assistantship 
Welcome! This is a repository for my code samples used in research assistatnship applications. 

In the master branch, for an easier review, I wrote "monolithic" code samples using the literate programming tools `markstat` (in the "Stata" folder, with a PDF output) and `R markdown` (in the "R" folder, with a PDF output).

To enhance transparency and reproducibility, I also modularized the two samples in two branches, "Stata" and "R", to better reflect my usual workflow in data cleaning and data analysis. The "R" branch is still under construction as I'm exploring to update the pipeline tool from [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake#:~:text=Instead%20of%20a%20Makefile%2C%20drake,are%20arbitrary%20variables%20in%20memory.&text=drake%20caches%20these%20objects%20in,to%20think%20about%20output%20files.).
